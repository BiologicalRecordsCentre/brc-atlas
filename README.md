# BRC Atlas library
The BRC Atlas library is a Javascript library for providing both easy and flexible APIs for creating static and slippy maps for atlas projects. In fact there are two libraries packaged in one project - one for British atlas mapping (`brcatlas.umd.js`) and one for European atlas mapping (`brcatlas_e.umd.js`).

## Installing
You can get the javscript amd css builds from 
the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas/tree/master/dist)
or include them in code directly from a CDN, e.g:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.js"></script>
```
or a minified version generated by the CDN:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.min.js"></script>
```
You will also need to inlcude the associated CSS, e.g:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.css">
```
or a minified version generated by the CDN:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.min.css">
```
The CDN also exposes some geojson assets. These are used internally by the mapping libraries, but can be used independently. They include:

- An outline map of Britain, Ireland and the Channel islands. These polygons are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-CI-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- British & Irish 100 km grid lines. These lines are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-grid-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- Brtish & Irish country boudaries. These lines are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-countries-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- Brtish & Irish vice county boundaries. These polygons are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-vcs-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- A range of geojson country and vice county boundary outlines in the folders ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/country``` and ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/vc```. These are defined at a number of scales suitable for different zoom levels on the slippy map. For more information, see [README for country assets](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas/tree/master/assets/country) and [README for vice county assets](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas/tree/master/assets/vc).

## API documentation and code examples
For details of the API, view the [JSDoc API documentation](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/brc-atlas/docs/api/).

There are also a number of [working examples](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/brc-atlas/docs/).

## Notes for developers
### Two libraries in one package ###
There are two libraries in this package:
 - `dist/brcatlas.umd.js` - for atlas mapping in Britain and Ireland
 - `dist/brcatlas_e.umd.js` - for atlas mapping over Europe

Although these libraries are bundled here in the same package, they are essentially different projects without any interdependendies.

### Typical build & publish workflow
- `npm audit --omit=dev` (look for any important vulnerabilities)
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run docs` 
- Update the version number in `package.json` 
- Ensure that `src/constants.hs` & `src_e/e_constants.js` are set up correctly (i.e. for production - not development)
- `npm run build` (after package update so that correct version is printed to console by library) 
- Update `docs/Readme` (if required, e.g. to link new examples) 
- Git add any new files
- Git commit all changes
- Git tag \<version>, e.g. `git tag 1.2.1`. Tag must match version number in package (to ensure that version can be used to target it in CDN) 
- Git push origin <version>, e.g. `git push origin 1.2.1` (pushes the tag commit) 
- `git push` (pushes to master branch) 
- Run the following links to purge the jsdelivr CDN caches
  - https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas@latest/dist/brcatlas.umd.js
