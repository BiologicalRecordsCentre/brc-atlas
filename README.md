### BRC Atlas library
The BRC Atlas library is a Javascript library for providing both easy and flexible APIs for creating static and slippy maps for atlas projects. In fact there are two libraries packaged in one project - one for British atlas mapping (`brcatlas.umd.js`) and one for European atlas mapping (`brcatlas_e.umd.js`).

## Installing
You can get the javscript amd css builds from 
the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas/tree/master/dist)
or include them in code directly from a CDN, e.g:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.js"></script>
```
or a minified version generated by the CDN:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.min.js"></script>
```
You will also need to inlcude the associated CSS, e.g:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.css">
```
or a minified version generated by the CDN:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/dist/brcatlas.umd.min.css">
```
The CDN also exposes some geojson assets. These are used internally by the mapping libraries, but can be used independently. They include:

- An outline map of Britain, Ireland and the Channel islands. These polygons are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-CI-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- British & Irish 100 km grid lines. These lines are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-grid-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- Brtish & Irish country boudaries. These lines are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-countries-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- Brtish & Irish vice county boundaries. These polygons are at a coarse scale - suitable for using with the static map. (```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/GB-I-vcs-27700-reduced.geojson```).
- A range of geojson country and vice county boundary outlines in the folders ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/country``` and ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/biologicalrecordscentre/brc-atlas/assets/vc```. These are defined at a number of scales suitable for different zoom levels on the slippy map. For more information, see [README for country assets](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas/tree/master/assets/country) and [README for vice county assets](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas/tree/master/assets/vc).
