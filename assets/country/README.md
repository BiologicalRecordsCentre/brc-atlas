All country boundary files in this were generated from VC data held on iRecord which, in turn, are created from data curated by BRC for British VCs (https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/vice-counties) and another repository for Irish VCs (https://github.com/SK53/Irish-Vice-Counties). However in the Derry/Londonderry area, where the VC boundaries do not follow modern national boundaries, the boundaries have been edited to reflect the national boundary.

Each of the boundary files has been generalised using the https://mapshaper.org/ website with a Douglas-peucker reduction. A setting of 80% was applied to 'countries-4326-80.geojson'. This figure gave a significant reduction of file size without really compromising the resolution of the lines. The settings used for the other files is expressed as the last figure in the file names.
